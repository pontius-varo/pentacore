# pentacore

Version: 0.03

+==========+

A simple text adventure game inspired by Zork, written in Python 3.5

This project primarily serves to better my understanding of Python and the abstract concepts of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

In addition, most of the underlying framework is inspired by another project made by a colleague of mine (read adam.py for more details). In the future, this will change significantly.

+==========+

To begin the program, use the terminal to arrive at the main directory. Then, use 'adam.py' to begin the program (ex. "user@desktop:~/pentacore/$ python3 adam.py").

Be sure to use Python 3.5+, as older versions of Python are not compatible with this program.
